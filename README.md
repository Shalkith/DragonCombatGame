# DragonCombatGame

## Introduction
Welcome to the DragonCombatGame repository, a fan-made digital adaptation of the classic pen-and-paper game "Shalkith: Last Kin." Our goal is to bring the rich, lore-driven experience of Shalkith into a new realm, initially focusing on fine-tuning the game mechanics before transitioning to a Discord integration.

## Project Phase
Currently, we are in the development phase, concentrating on establishing robust and engaging game mechanics. The future phases will include porting the game to Discord, allowing for an interactive and communal gaming experience.

## Features (In Development)
- **Adapted Gameplay**: Bringing the intricate mechanics of Shalkith into a digital format.
- **Lore Integration**: Faithfully preserving the rich narrative and setting of the original game.
- **Future Discord Integration**: Plans to migrate the gameplay experience to Discord, enabling online community interactions and play.
